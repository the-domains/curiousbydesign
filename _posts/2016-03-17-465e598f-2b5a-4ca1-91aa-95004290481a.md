Its all connected. Isn't it?

Design is everywhere. In big ideas and tiny details. It converses without language. It connects across mediums. Design is riveting, fascinating, and it makes me curious. Makes me question. Questions that make observe, discover, rip elements apart, fail. Questions that make me seek more questions. And while I backpack from one question to another, I connect, collaborate, learn, unlearn... But mostly learn. Design is everywhere and I am simply curious by design.
